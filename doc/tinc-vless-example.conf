# BindToAddress = 0.0.0.0

# Bind to specific port

# Device type: tun (IP tunnel) or tap (Ethernet tunnel)

# ==========================================
# VLESS Protocol Configuration
# ==========================================

# Enable VLESS mode

# VLESS UUID (generate with: uuidgen or use Reality key generator)
# This is your server UUID - clients must use this UUID to connect

# ==========================================
# Reality Protocol Configuration
# ==========================================

# Enable Reality protocol (obfuscation + fallback)
VLESSReality = yes

# Destination for fallback (when connection is not authenticated)
# This should be a real HTTPS website - your traffic will look like connections to this site
VLESSRealityDest = www.google.com

# Destination port for fallback
VLESSRealityDestPort = 443

# Server Name Indication (SNI) - what the client will send in TLS handshake
# Can be same as VLESSRealityDest or different
# Leave empty to use hostname from connection

# Reality Private Key (server side) - generate with Reality key generator
# Generate using: openssl rand -hex 32

# Automatically connect to other nodes
AutoConnect = yes

# Maximum number of outgoing connections
MaxConnectionBurst = 10

# Ping interval

# Ping timeout

# ==========================================
# Example: Connecting to other nodes
# ==========================================

# To connect to another node, add:
# ConnectTo = othernode
#
# And create a file in hosts/othernode with:
# - Address = hostname or IP
# - Port = 655 (or their port)
# - Subnet = their VPN subnet
# - Their ECDSA public key (generated by tinc)
#
# For VLESS: The other node must also have VLESSMode enabled
# For Reality: Both nodes should have compatible Reality settings
